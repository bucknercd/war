This java project has is about the card game called war. It has 3 different variations
of war and has a logger than prints to stdout as well as to a logfile. I used an abstract
class for War and the 3 variations inherit attributes from this class.

I have included a UML diagram as well. Use violet to open.
My gitignore ignores all eclipse file settings and the bin directory.

clone this repo and import in eclipse or you could do it all on the commandline.
Although I did not create a makefile for this project as I did everything in eclipse.

I have included a Runner so there is an entry point and one can use the classes I wrote.
Also there are unit tests as well which invoke the program.
